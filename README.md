The first part requires the implementation of selection sort. The method optionally accepts a boolean argument for performing an ascending or descending sorting. The parameter should be set to true for True is ascending sort, else it will perform a descending sort if set to false.
 
The second part requires the implementation of mergeSort. However, it will accept a parameter 'k', and any numbers dividable by 'k' should be first in the sorted sequence. See the method's prologue in ProblemSolutions.java for more details on the expected sorting output.
