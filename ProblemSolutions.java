     * allows the second parameter to be optional, and if not provided, defaults to an
     * ascending sort. If the second parameter is provided and is false, a descending
     * sort is performed.
     *
     * @param values        - int[] array to be sorted.
     * @param ascending     - if true,method performs an ascending sort, else descending.
     *                        There are two method signatures allowing this parameter
     *                        to not be passed and defaulting to 'true (or ascending sort).

     *  list. Example:
     *        values = { 10, 3, 25, 8, 6 }, k = 5

     *        Sorted result should be --> { 30, 18, 6, 12, 9, 22, 39, 45 }
     *
     * As shown above, this is a normal merge sort operation, except for the numbers
     * divisible by 'k' are first in the sequence.
     *

    /**
     * Method asteroidsDestroyed
     *
     * You are given an integer 'mass', which represents the original mass of a planet.
     * You are further given an integer array 'asteroids', where asteroids[i] is the mass
     * of the ith asteroid.
     *
     * You can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in any arbitrary order.
     * If the mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the mass of the asteroid, the
     * asteroid is destroyed and the planet gains the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the
     * planet is destroyed.
     *
     * Return true if possible for all asteroids to be destroyed. Otherwise, return false.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *   Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
     *   Output: true
     *
     * Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
     * - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
     * - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
     * - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
     * - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
     * - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67
     * All asteroids are destroyed.
     *
     * Example 2:
     *   Input: mass = 5, asteroids = [4,9,23,4]
     *   Output: false
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The planet cannot ever gain enough mass to destroy the asteroid with a mass of 23.
     * After the planet destroys the other asteroids, it will have a mass of 5 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 22.
     * This is less than 23, so a collision would not destroy the last asteroid.
     *
     * Constraints:
     *     1 <= mass <= 105
     *     1 <= asteroids.length <= 105
     *     1 <= asteroids[i] <= 105
     *
     * @param mass          - integer value representing the mass of the planet
     * @param asteroids     - integer array of the mass of asteroids
     * @return              - return true if all asteroids destroyed, else false.
